# Data_structure_c_programming
This Project is a self-study practice for myself only.  
Daily Practice of date structure and algorithms.  
** KEEPING DOING, KEEPING PRACTICING**
# Infos
This Practice Project is base on book Algorithms in C  
This book is intended to survey the most important computer algorithms in use today. and to teach fundamental techniques to the growing number of people in need of knowing them.  
This book is provided for student or developer who have acquired basic skills and familiarity with programming.
# Scope
16 Chapters grouped into four major parts:
Part    I   cover fundamental concepts
PART    II  cover data structures
PART    III cover sorting algorithms 
PART    IV  cover searching algorithms
This book is intended for anyone conversant with a modern crogramming language and with the basic features of modern computer systems.
# Programming Language
The programming language used for all of the implementations is C. The strategy that we should use for understanding the program is to implement and test them , to experiment with variants.

### Note for this courses

#### some basic knowledge
 Three point to help us master in something.
 * Chunk it up
 * Delibrate practicing  
    ** 坚持 可以练习  
    ** 练习缺陷 弱点地方  
    ** 不舒服、不爽、枯燥
 * Feedback
 what should we do to preper for data structure ?  
 * Clarification
 * Possible Slution: compare(time/space) and optimal(be much stronger)
 * Coding
 * test casess
 #### Algorithm Complexity
 * 时间复杂度  

 * 空间复杂度
 #### Data Structure

 #### Algorithm
